The `Representational` function takes three color channels (red, green, and blue) as input and returns a value based on their intensity. The `calculate` function takes an image as input and applies the `Representational` function to each pixel to obtain a new set of values. The main function reads two images, calculates the difference between them using the `calculate` function, and computes the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for the difference using the formula `10 * log10(error / (255 * 255))`.",
